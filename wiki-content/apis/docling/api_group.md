# API Group: Docling

## Overview
The `Docling` API group defines a set of APIs that are associated with the `docling` functionality. It includes metadata such as a canonical identifier and tags for categorization. This structure helps in organizing and managing related APIs within the system.

## Details
- **API Group Name**: Docling
- **Canonical Identifier**: `xSkZ83KQ`
- **Tags**: 
  - `docling`

## How it works
The `Docling` API group is defined using a simple structure that includes:
- A unique `canonical` identifier which serves as a reference for this API group.
- An array of `tags` that categorize the API group, making it easier to search and filter within the API documentation.

## Notes
- The `canonical` identifier is crucial for referencing this API group in other parts of the system.
- The `tags` can be expanded to include more categories as needed.
- [TODO] Additional functionality or endpoints associated with this API group may need to be documented separately.
