# LLM API Group

## Overview
The LLM API Group defines a set of configurations for the API related to the LLM (Large Language Model) services. It includes a unique identifier and a Swagger token for API documentation and interaction. This setup is essential for enabling developers to access and utilize the LLM functionalities effectively.

## Details
- **API Group Name**: LLM
- **Canonical Identifier**: `Tst8w4S6`
- **Swagger Token**: 
  - Key: `token`
  - Value: `djPH6H9pQyZTSQYhh6mdqCNGQ8g`
  
This configuration is typically used to facilitate API documentation and client generation through Swagger.

## How it works
1. The `api_group` declaration creates a new API group named `LLM`.
2. The `canonical` field assigns a unique identifier to the API group, which can be used for reference in documentation and API calls.
3. The `swagger` field includes a token that enables the integration of Swagger UI for interactive API documentation, allowing developers to explore and test the API endpoints.

## Notes
- The `canonical` identifier should be unique across all API groups to prevent conflicts.
- The Swagger token is sensitive and should be kept secure to prevent unauthorized access to the API documentation.
- [TODO] Additional details regarding the endpoints and functionalities provided by the LLM API group are not specified in this file.
