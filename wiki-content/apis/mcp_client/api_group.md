# MCP Client API Group

## Overview
The MCP Client API Group defines a collection of APIs related to the MCP (Multi-Channel Platform) client. This configuration includes a canonical identifier and a Swagger token for API documentation and interaction. It serves as a foundational element for organizing and accessing related API endpoints.

## Details
- **API Group Name**: MCP Client
- **Canonical ID**: `jwozKqfW`
- **Swagger Token**: `-PBi5uf7tPNqayqb00Fn2TF5wzo`
- **Purpose**: To group and manage APIs associated with the MCP client.

## How it works
- The `api_group` directive creates a new API group named "MCP Client".
- The `canonical` property provides a unique identifier for the group, which can be used for reference in documentation and API management.
- The `swagger` property includes a token that is likely used to authenticate or access the Swagger UI for this API group, enabling developers to explore and test the APIs.

## Notes
- Ensure that the Swagger token is kept secure and is not exposed publicly.
- The canonical ID should be unique across all API groups to avoid conflicts.
- [TODO] Additional details about the specific APIs included in this group and their functionalities may be required for comprehensive documentation.
